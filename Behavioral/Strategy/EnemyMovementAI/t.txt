🎯 Task: Enemy AI Movement Strategy
You're building a simple top-down 2D game. Enemies have 
different movement behaviors (strategies) like:

ChasePlayer: Follows the player directly.

PatrolArea: Moves between predefined patrol points.

RandomWander: Moves randomly within a radius.

Implement the Strategy Pattern so the Enemy class can switch between 
these behaviors at runtime. 
Example situations:

An enemy starts with PatrolArea.

When the player is detected, it switches to ChasePlayer.

If the player escapes, it switches to RandomWander.

Requirements:
An IMovementStrategy interface.

At least the three strategies mentioned.

An Enemy class that can be given a strategy and execute it through Move().

Simulate a scenario (e.g., in EnemyDemo) where strategy changes happen based 
on simple conditions (e.g., "Player in range").
