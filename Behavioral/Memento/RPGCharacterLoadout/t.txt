Scenario:
You’re making a small RPG system where a player can equip weapons and armor.
The player wants to save and load previous equipment configurations (loadouts) — like “stealth build,” “tank build,” etc.

Goal:
Implement a system using the Memento pattern to:

Equip new items (e.g., sword, shield, helmet)

Save the current loadout

Restore a previously saved loadout

Show current loadout

Requirements
Character class should have:

EquipWeapon(string name)

EquipArmor(string name)

SaveLoadout() – returns a Memento

LoadLoadout(Memento m) – restores from a Memento

ShowLoadout() – prints current items

LoadoutMemento class stores a snapshot of the current loadout.

A simple LoadoutManager (Caretaker) holds saved Mementos by name ("stealth", "tank").
